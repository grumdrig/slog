<h1>Progress Quest Slog: Chinbreak Island</h1>

<p> Welcome to PQS:CI. You can skip the rigamore and <a
href='chinbreak.html'>play the game</a>, or read on for the rigamarole,
including links to many moving parts.

<h3>What it is</h3>

<p> There are many layers to this onion.

<p> <a href='chinbreak.html'>Chinbreak Island</a> is a game in the Progress
Quest Automatic Universe&#8482;, with appearance, style and gameplay similar
to the original <a href="http://progressquest.com/">Progress Quest</a>
released in 2002. It's an idle/zero-player game, meaning your character does
the thinking, clicking and hotkey-pressing for you, while you either watch or
occupy yourself with other more important tasks.

<h3>Strats</h3>

<p> However, unlike the original, where your character's play style is fixed,
here your character's actions are determined by a programmable strategy that
it follows. A player selects a strategy at the time of character creation. It
may be built-in to the game, or gotten from elsewhere.

<p> But! However! You may also write or modify a character strategy yourself.

<h3>Slog VM</h3>

<p> The active strategy is followed in the game by operating a virtual machine
within which the strategy 1) observes the state of the game and 2) gives
instructions to the character, analogous to a human (or humanoid) player
watching a game and clicking buttons and so on.

<p> This virtual machine is called the <a href='vm.html'>Slog Virtual
Machine</a>.

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p> There is an <a href='asm.html'>assembly language and an associated macro
assembler</a> which targets the SVM, but, more practically, there is a <a
href='language.html'>higher level language called Slog</a>, and a compliler
for it. Those who wish to develop strategies can use these tools, or any
other means they may devise, to produce machine code suitable for the SVM.

<p> These tools are written in <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a> and
can be used from the command line by checking out <a
href='https://github.com/grumdrig/slog'>the code</a>.

<h3>IDE</h3>

<p> There is also <a href='ide.html'>an in-browser integrated development
environment</a> of sorts, which can be useful for trying, tweaking and
debugging strategies.

<h3>This is Alpha</h3>

<p> The compiler and virtual machine seem fairly stable, but the Chinbreak
Island module is very much in an alpha stage of development. For example, the
play balance is screwy, there's no save/load functionality, and there's
probably many, many bugs.

<p> If you have a suggestion or find a bug in the game, IDE, documentation,
compiler, assembler, virtual machine, or anything else, please feel
encouraged to <a href='https://github.com/grumdrig/slog/issues'>report it on
github</a>.

<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<p> The first priority is to fix bugs and fix the play balance. After these
things there are many follow on ideas to implement, such as

<ul>
<li>multiplayer / PvP / battle royale
<li>leader boards
<li>other modules, e.g. a dungeon crawler
<li>sequels where winning characters can continue on
<li>entirely different genres and game styles
</ul>
