Slog Language Manual
====================

This document serves to describe the Slog language.

Compiler
========

The Slog compiler processes high-level source code into assembly language
code, which may then be assmbled into machine code suitable for the Slog
Virtual Machine.

Language
========

The Slog language is fairly simple, and somewhat C-like. There are no
semicolons.

Here's an atypical example, but the closest we can get to the classic "Hello,
world!":

TODO: string passing may be incorrect here

	macro print(message) external(65, &message)
	print("Hello, world!")

Here's a more involved, but still not relevant, example, implementing Euclid's
algorithm:

	func gcd(a, b) {
		while a != b {
			if a > b {
				a = a - b
			} else {
				b = b - a
			}
		}
		return a
	}

	assert gcd(12, 15) == 3


Lexical Analysis
================

As the first step of compilation, the source code text is analyzed by the
lexer to filter comments and produce a stream of lexemes from what remains.


Comments
--------

Comment syntax is C-like.

The part of any line after the line comment marker `//` is ignored by the
lexer. Example:

	a = 5  // set a to this many

Any part of the source between the markers `/*` and `*/` is ignored by the lexer. These symbols can be nested. E.g.:

	/* this a comment /* deep in a comment */ comment is still going */


Identifiers
-----------

Identifiers are a familiar combination of alphanumerics and the underscore
character. Of course the first character can't be a numeral.


Numbers
-------

The target architecture of the language has only one data type, Int16, the
signed 16-bit integer, so the only literals recognized by the compiler
resolve to Int16s, or vectors of them. They may be specified in decimal form
with an optional sign, so that the following are valid numeric literals:

	26, -3, 0, 30000, +32

They may also be given in hexadecimal form by prededing them with a dollar
sign '$' character, like these:

	$1ff $0 -$50 +$BAD


Characters
----------

A character encosed in single quites, a la:

	'c'  // equivalent to 99

is also an Int16, the ordinal of the character inside the single quotes.

Two characters may also appear inside the quotes, and the ordinals are stored
in the low and high bytes of a single Int16. Thus:

	'hi' // equal to $6869


Vectors
-------

Literal vectors are written by enclosing a sequence of comma-separated values
in brackets, like so:

	[1, 2, 3, $44, -100, 2 * pi, angle]

There are no vectors of vectors; vectors only contain Int16s. Expressions
within vector literals must be resolvable to actual numbers at compile time.


Strings
-------

A double-quoted string is equivalent to a vector literal, with an implied 0 at
the end. So the following are equivalent:

	"hello"

and

	[104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0]

There is very little support in the language for string manipulation.


Operators
---------

Any number of operator characters juxtaposed are lexed as a single operator.
Many such operators are invalid in the language, so whitespace should be used
to separate operator characters when separate operators are intended. The
operator characters are these:

	- + = < > * / % ^ & | ! ?


Punctuation
-----------

Punctuation characters are always lexed singly, so don't need whitespace
around them. The following are the punctuation characters:

	. , ~ @ # ( ) { } [ ]

Not all of them have a use in the language.


Language Structure
==================

A module, or file, is a single block of text, consisting of declarations,
definitions, and executable statements. A module consists of a number of
declarations and statements.


Variables
=========

A variables may be declared with `var` followed by its name, an identifier,
with an optional initializer.

	var x = 6
	var y
	var z = fibonacci(16)

Absent an initialzier, variables are initialized to 0 in the global scope, but
if declared within a function an uninitialized variable's value is
undefined.


Vectors
=======

Vectors are a number of consecutive numeric values in memory. The may be
declared and initialized in a few different ways, demonstrated here:

	var a = [1, 2, 3]  // in memory: [1, 2, 3]
	var b[3]           // in memory: [?, ?, ?] (see below)
	var c[3] = 4       // in memory: [4, 4, 4]
	var d[3] = [5,6,7] // in memory: [5, 6, 7] (but see below)

If a vector length and a vector initializer are both given, as in the last
example, the lengths must match.

In the no-initializer case as with `b` above, the memory is initialized to 0
for global variables, but has undefined initial values if declared within the
scope of a function.

The elements of a vector may be accessed or modified by postfixing an index
within brackets. Indices are zero-based.

	assert a[1] == 2
	assert a[a[1]] == 3
	a[0] = 10
	assert a[0] == 10

Array indexing works on any expression, if you want to get into trouble. E.g.
`0[0]` is the first word in main memory. Jump program execution to address
100 by modifying the PC register directly with `(-1)[0] = 100` if you dare.


Looping Statement
=================

There is a single looping statement in the language, the `while` loop. It has
the form

`while` *condition-expr* `{` *code-block* `}`

It operates by repeatedly executing *code-block* as long as *condition-expr*
evaluates to non-zero.

The while loop can be exited from within the code block using a `break`
statement (or a `return` statement, if the loop is inside of a function).

	var factorial = 1
	var n = 10
	while n > 1 {
		factorial *= n
		n -= 1
		if factorial > 15000 {
			// getting too big
			break
		}
	}


Conditional Statement
=====================

The conditional statement executes a block of code if a condition holds (that is, if *condition-expr* evaluates to a non-zero number), and optionally, another block of code otherwise.

`if` *condition-expr* `{` *code-block* `}` [`else` `{` *code-block* `}`]

if the optional *else-clause* is another if statement, the '{' '}' braces can be omitted, like so:

	if x < 0 {
		sign = -1
	} else if x > 0 {
		sign = 1
	} else {
		sign = 0
	}


Functions
=========

Functions may be defined using the `func` keyword and an identifier to name
it. A parenthesized, comma-separated parameter list follows, then a block of
code which is executes when the function is called.

The function is called by passing a parenthesized list of comma-separated
arguments to the function.

For example:

	func factorial(x) {
		if x <= 1 {
			return x
		} else {
			return x * factorial(x - 1)
		}
	}

	assert factorial(3) == 6

Rather than a brace-enclosed block of code, a single expression may stand in
as the function body. In this case, the value of the expression is implicitly
returned by the function. For example:

	func factorialAlso(x) x <= 1 and 1 or x * factorialAlso(x - 1)

All functions return a number. Absent an explicit `return` statement, a value
of zero will be returned when execution reaches the end of the code block.


Macros
======

The syntax of macro definitions exactly mirror those of functions, except that
the keyword `macro` is used in place of `func`. Macros differ from function
in that a copy of the macro body replaces the macro call, at that point in
the code, rather than jumping to another portion of code where the function
body resides.


Expressions
===========

The usual expresion rules from C-like languages apply. Besides literal values,
expressions can use parentheses to group operators, which may be prefix,
infix and postfix operations.


Prefix Operators
================

Prefix operators precede an expression.

| Operator | Meaning                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `+`      | Positive sign (essentially, no effect)     |
| `-`      | Arithmetic negation                        |
| `~`      | Bitwise complement                         |
| `!`      | Logical negation (0 if non-zero, else 1)   |
| `&`      | Address-of (memory location of expression) |
| `*`      | Derefence (value at memory location)       |
| `.`      | State vector access (explained below)      |

The `&` address-of operator only applies to addressible expressions: variables
and vector-index expressions.


Infix Operators
===============

Infixes appear between two expression and combine them to produce a single
result as per the following table:

| Operator | Meaning                     |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `**`     | Power                       |
| `%%`     | Root                        |
| `*`      | Multiplication              |
| `/`      | Division                    |
| `%`      | Remainder                   |
| `+`      | Addition                    |
| `-`      | Subtraction                 |
| `<?`     | Minimum                     |
| `>?`     | Maximum                     |
| `<<`     | Bit shift left              |
| `>>`     | Bit shift right             |
| `&`      | Bitwise and                 |
| `^`      | Bitwise xor                 |
| `\|`     | Bitwise or                  |
| `<`      | Less than                   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to       |
| `>`      | Greater than                |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to    |
| `==`     | Equal to                    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                |
| `and`    | Logical and                 |
| `xor`    | Logical xor                 |
| `or`     | Logical or                  |
| `=`      | Assignment                  |
| `+=`     | Increment                   |
| `-=`     | Decrement                   |
| `*=`     | Multiplication-assignment   |
| `/=`     | Division-assignment         |
| `%=`     | Remainder-assignment        |
| `<<=`    | Bit-shift-left-assignment   |
| `>>=`    | Bit-shift-right-assignment  |
| `&=`     | Bitwise-and-assignment      |
| `^=`     | Bitwise-xor-assignment      |
| `\|=`    | Bitwise-or-assignment       |

Most of these will be familiar to most programmers.

The `<?` minimum and `>?` maximum operators are probably self-explanatory.

The `%%` root operator calculates nth root, so for `x %% y`, the result is `x`
to the `1/y`th power, as an integer.

Of course the assignment and operator-assignment operators can only have
addressible expression on their left hand side: variables and vector index
expressions.


State Variables and External Function Calls
===========================================

Per the design of the Slog virtual machine, Slog programs have access to the
game in which they are embedded in two ways: external function calls, and
access to state variables.

The state variables are read-only within the program. They are accessed with
the state-access operator `.` followed by a state vector index. The valid
state vector indices will normally be defined as constants using an interface
published by the embedding game.

So for example:

	const LivesRemaining = $20  // interface definition

	if .LivesRemaining == 1 {
		// Oh no! Need to be more careful.
		activateCarefulMode()
	}

The external function call is a special function named `external`, the first
parameter of which is an opaque number defining the effect of the function
call. Other parameters may follow. The call is dispatched to the embedding
game or application.

The embedding game should provide macro definitions to give semantic meaning
to the code numbers. So:

	// Interface definition:
	macro hunt(quarry) external(135, quarry)
	macro eat(food) external(136, food)
	// State vector indices:
	const Hunger = 10   // Avatar's hunger level
	const Rabbits = 11  // Available number of rabbits

	// Strategy logic:
	if .Hunger > 0 {
		hunt(Rabbits)
		if .Rabbits > 0 {
			eat(Rabbits)
		}
	}
